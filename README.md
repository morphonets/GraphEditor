## GraphEditor

A mavenized version of [JGraphX](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx)]'s [editor](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx/tree/master/examples/com/mxgraph/examples/swing/editor). It served as a prototyping playground for SNT's [Graph Viewer](https://github.com/morphonets/SNT/tree/master/src/main/java/sc/fiji/snt/viewer)—SNT's GUI for neuroanatomical graphs and diagrams—and is no longer under development.
